Project Overview

Respiratory diseases such as Pneumonia, COVID-19, and Tuberculosis affect millions of people worldwide. Early detection is important for proper treatment and reducing health risks.

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system that can analyze Chest X-ray images and assist in identifying respiratory diseases.


Problem Statement

Limited availability of expert radiologists and similarity in X-ray patterns often lead to delayed or inaccurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases.  
This project aims to build an automated system to support early detection using deep learning.



Objectives

Build a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
Train the model on chest X-ray images.
Evaluate the performance using accuracy.
Extend the model for multi-class disease detection in future phases.



Current Progress (Midterm Status)

Literature survey completed.
Dataset collected and organized.
Basic CNN model implementation started.
Initial training performed.



Tools Used

Python
VS Code
TensorFlow (for building model)
Matplotlib (for plotting results)



Future Work

Improve model accuracy.
Implement multi-class classification.
Add explainability techniques (Grad-CAM).
Develop simple user interface for testing.
